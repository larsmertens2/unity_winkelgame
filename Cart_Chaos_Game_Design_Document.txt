# Game Design Document: "Cart Chaos" (Working Title)

## 1. Game Overview
| Aspect         | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| **Genre**      | Competitive, first-person party game |
| **Platform**   | PC |
| **Engine**     | Unity |
| **Multiplayer**| Unity Relay (room code based, 2–4 players) |
| **Perspective**| First-person |
| **Tone**       | Silly, chaotic, lighthearted |
| **Session**    | 60 seconds per match |
| **Victory**    | Most item value scored at end of timer |
| **Map**        | Single supermarket map with static layout (more planned later) |

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop
1. Navigate the supermarket using first-person controls.
2. Find items placed on store shelves (static locations).
3. Pick up one item at a time.
4. Bring items to your own movable shopping cart.
5. Push your cart to the Checkout Zone.
6. Score items in the cart by entering the zone.
7. Repeat until time runs out.

## 3. Player & Cart Mechanics
### Player Actions
- Pick up item (1 at a time)
- Drop item manually
- Push/pull own cart
- Push other players' carts
- Steal items from another player’s cart if not scored

### Cart System
- Each player has a physical, movable cart
- Carts:
  - Can be pushed freely
  - Can be bumped by others
  - Cannot be flipped, blocked, or destroyed
- Carts do not auto-follow — players must push them manually
- Items placed in carts remain until scored, stolen, or dropped

## 4. Item System
- Items:
  - Placed on static shelves/racks
  - Always spawn in same layout each round
  - Have randomized value per round ($1–$50)
  - May vary in size/appearance but have no weight mechanics

## 5. Scoring System
| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Enter Checkout Zone with cart | Instantly scores all current cart items |
| Scored items | Locked (can’t be stolen) |
| Unscored items in cart | Vulnerable to theft |
| Final score | Total $ value of items scored in time limit |

- Optional tie-breaker: number of items scored, or first to score final item.

## 6. Match Structure
- Game Length: 60 seconds
- Players: 2–4 (networked using Unity Relay)
- Replayability:
  - Static map encourages route mastery
  - Randomized item prices keep rounds unpredictable

## 7. Map Design
**Setting:** A cluttered but structured supermarket  
**Features:**
- Static aisles and shelves
- Pre-defined item spawn locations
- Central Checkout Zone
- Optional environmental elements (e.g., sliding doors)

## 8. Game Feel & Tone
- Silly, chaotic atmosphere (e.g. Overcooked/Fall Guys)
- Physics-driven comedy: carts bumping, items falling
- Bright, cartoony, low-poly supermarket aesthetic

## 9. Multiplayer (Unity Relay)
- Relay used for low-friction P2P multiplayer
- Players join via room code
- Host is authoritative
- No matchmaking — lobby based
- Round restarts handled by host

## 10. Audio & Visuals
- Visuals: Bright, colorful, low-poly
- Audio:
  - Upbeat music
  - SFX for grabbing, dropping, scoring, bumping
  - Optional announcer commentary

## 11. Future Features
- Power-ups (speed boost, sticky cart, price scanner)
- Hazards (slippery floor, NPC shoppers)
- Cosmetics (cart skins, player outfits)
- Map variants (mall, electronics store)
- Match customization (longer timer, rare high-value items)

## 12. UI/UX Elements
- Timer (top center)
- Scoreboard (side or tab view)
- Item value popup when held
- Checkout feedback (sound + floating text)

## 13. Technical Notes
- Networking: Unity Relay (Relay + Lobby)
- Carts: Rigidbody physics
- Items: ScriptableObjects for price/value/visuals
- Authority: Host simulation, no server persistence

## 14. Layout Concept (Supermarket Map)
**Layout Zones:**
1. Entrance (spawn points for players)
2. Aisles: 3–5 aisles, static layout
3. Shelves: Hold items, fixed per aisle
4. Central Checkout Zone: Wide area with scoring trigger
5. Wall perimeter: Decorative or blocked

**Sample Layout (Top-Down View):**
+--------------------------------+
| [ Wall / Decorations ]         |
|                                |
|  Aisle 1   Aisle 2   Aisle 3   |
|  [----]   [----]   [----]      |
|  [----]   [----]   [----]      |
|                                |
|          Checkout Zone         |
|        [ Scoring Area ]        |
|                                |
